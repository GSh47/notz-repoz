This is an unofficial notes repository website containing my notes from the semester


>[!danger] **DISCLAIMER** 
>These notes aren't exactly perfect and are likely to contain typos, code errors,  factual errors or sections that might be entirely missing altogether that I might have not even noticed in class. 
>
>Any sort of help in sorting these issues is very much appreciated. 




Feedback and comments would be delightful in helping me improve the notes for all of us. If there is anything you would like to add to the notes to provide better understanding or context or just general information regarding the topics from the lecture : I would be thrilled to acknowledge with due credit. [[You can contact me here]]
