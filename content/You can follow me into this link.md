 Haha, it's the end of the line people. This has been a ...... an interesting few years that went by in your company. This is the last push before the dawn (I know you're probably reading this at 12 am before an exam, hi-five to you !) I wish you the best. Click on tomorrow's paper to start. Some pages are still being updated if ykwim. 

>[!Caution] Uhm..!
>Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very sorry for the delay. 
>I was ambushed with the unexpected news of several interviews scheduled at multiple institutes around 19th -25th  of April. It clashed with my expected schedule of launch and my own preparation for the exam and the interview. It's painful that I had to make some sacrifices. I was almost done with Linear Algebra :(

>Anyways, enjoy PH6123, I shall hopefully upload MT6223 ontime !
