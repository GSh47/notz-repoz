One thing that haunts my daydreams is the [Tu160 "Blackjack"](https://tupolev.ru/en/planes/tu-160/) bomber and the sheer engineering that went into it. I had a poster of this on my bedroom wall as a smoll boi. Of course the design that went into this required a lot of  CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics), which as you may have guesssed contains [[Green]] , [[Gauss]] and [[Stokes Theorem]] theorem among other things which I learnt to appreciate long ago thanks to the few and rare people who were willing to sit and talk about this to me without dismissing me for being too young. 

You'll love this part if you'd like to go do fluid dynamics ! an amazing field that gave us wonderful things. 

A lot of math drenched fluid dynamics and mechanical engineering  later, we get this... This is what I call modern art..

>[!danger] rant about art. 
>(yeah that entire esoteric argument about functionality and sending a message. Sure the[ banana taped to a wall](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/yellow-banana-duct-taped-to-a-wall-turns-into-rs-52-35-crore-artwork-why-maurizio-cattelans-comedian-has-stunned-the-art-world/articleshow/115536437.cms) sends some message to some lame chap, but so does a [Kh15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh-15) !
>Now that's what I call "if looks could kill"
