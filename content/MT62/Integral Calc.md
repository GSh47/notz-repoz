>Now intuitonally - this paper makes me happy and sad. The problems make me happy as do some interesting theorems, but it's the small and obvious proofs that drive me crazy as someone who has committed himself to experiments over theory. So forgive my bias. I am not justified here.. just a matter of preferences actually.

A fitting song for the end !

So basically the message of the whole paper is that :

ANd then play around with the said integral to figure out new things. 

In the voice of [Jeremy Clarkson, "*In tonight's episode ..*"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Jtr6A3QMk)
- We define the integral as certain sums, for this paper we stick to [[Darboux sums]] as a precursor of the cooler and famous Riemann sums. 
- We check conditions that allow for [[integrability]] of a given [[function]].
- State the [[fundamental theorem of calulus]]... I personally think it's a bit late for this -  we should've seen this in school. 

And for those who can think geometrically (I can hear a certain professor glare at me from the other side of the city ... )

- We try computing [[areas and volumes]] with integrals, figure out how to for special cases 
- Understand integral [[averages]]
- learn to [[Switching coordinate systems]] or spaces for the things we've done so far
And we revisit vector calc from last sem to do
- [[Line integrals]] 
and learn a few impressive and important [[Theorems]]
