# Average value of function of two variables

To compute the average value of the function $f(x):[a,b]$ we compute the integral of $f$ over the given interval and divide it by range or length of integral.
The area of the function in a 2D space divided by length : $$\langle f(x) \rangle=\left( \frac{1}{b-a} \right)\int _{a}^a f(x)\, dx  $$
if $f(x,y)$ is a positive function over region $R$ then the double integral measures the volume under the surface. If we divide this volume by the area of the region, we get the average value of $f(x,y)$ over $R$ $$\langle f(x,y) \rangle=\frac{1}{A} \iint _{R} f(x,y) \, dA  $$
If we divide the volume of the enclosed space by the area of the base, we get the height of the box.
