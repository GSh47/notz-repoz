The intensity of Xray dpends on filament of current, the quality of Xray is dependent on Voltage across the filament
The photons are released as a form of Bremsstrahlung radiation when an electron passing by a nucleus bends - changing it's velocity. The lost energy is conserved as a photon ox xray
Assuming a case where teh electron completely stops after being deflected by a nuclei, the energy of photon is $h\nu=eV$, the energy of electron. Thus the max frequency is $\nu_{max}= \frac{eV}{h}$ and it's corresponding wavelength is $\lambda_{min}=\frac{hc}{eV}$. this is 'Continuous Xray' The distribution of emitted wavelength is similar to boltzmann distribution
Assume another case where an electron intercepts another electron in the metal, knocking it out of orbit, another electron from a higher orbit descends to this state by releasing some radiation - this is called 'Characteristic Xray' the spectrum emitted is dependent on property of metal, has two peaks mostly called $K\alpha$ nd $K\beta$  imposed onto continuous xray distribution

We use characteristic xray for XRD because the need for a monochromatic source.
