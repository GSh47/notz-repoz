Let us consider a crystal made up of equidistant parallel planes of atoms with the inter-
planer spacing dhkl. Further, consider a monochromatic x-ray beam of wavelength λ having a
common wave front, falls at an angle θ on the planes as shown in Figure. Each atom
scatters the x-rays more or less uniformly in all directions, but because of the periodic
arrangement of atoms, the scattered radiation from all atoms in a set of planes is in phase
where they interfere constructively. In all other directions, there is destructive interference.

2d\sin \theta=n\lambda

## Limitations 
- Assumes monochromaticity and crystalline structutre. not applicable else
- applicable only if $\lambda <2d$ as per the sine inverse we see. 
- at lower angles, the sine $\sin \theta$ tends to zero, affecting precision
- Diffraction patterns are weak for thin films,
