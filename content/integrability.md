Let $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded function, then $f$ is integrale iff $\forall\epsilon >0:\forall$ partition $P[a,b]$ with $\mu(P)<\delta$ we have $U(P,f)-L(P,f)<\epsilon$ 
this theorem says that when partiotion size is small, the difference between upper and lower sums for that partition should be small. 
 
 #remark  $$\lim_{ \mu(P) \to 0 }U(P,f)=\lim_{ \mu(P) \to 0 }L(P,f)=\int _{a}^bf  $$ if both limits exist and are equal. 

Another criteria could be : 
Let $f:[a,b]\to \mathbb{R}$ be bounded function, then $f$ is integrable iff $\forall\epsilon>0\exists$ a partitiion $P$ of $[a,b]$ for which $U(P,f)-L(P,f)<\epsilon$
