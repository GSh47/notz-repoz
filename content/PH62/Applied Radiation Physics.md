1. $\alpha$ particles 
2. $\beta$
3. $\gamma$
4. neutron

## Radiation effects 
- Soamtic 
- Genetic effect - cause genetic damage

# Hazards
Radiation hazards arise primarily from ionizing radiation, which includes alpha (α), beta
(β), gamma (γ) rays, neutrons, and X-rays. These forms of radiation can remove tightly
bound electrons from atoms, leading to ionization that damages biological tissues. Ionizing
radiation can be natural (cosmic rays, radon gas) or man-made (nuclear reactors, medical
equipment). Prolonged or high-intensity exposure can lead to severe biological
consequences, necessitating strict control and safety measures in workplaces and medical
environments.

# Biological Effects of Radiation
Radiation affects living cells through direct ionization of cellular molecules, particularly
DNA, or indirectly via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Damage can result in
mutations, cell death, or carcinogenesis. Biological effects are categorized into:
- Deterministic effects: severity increases with dose (e.g., skin burns, sterility, cataracts).
- Stochastic effects: probability increases with dose but severity is independent (e.g., cancer, genetic mutations).
# Radiation Sickness
Radiation sickness, or acute radiation syndrome (ARS), results from a high dose of radiation
in a short time. Symptoms depend on dose:
- <1 Gy: minor blood changes.
- 1–2 Gy: nausea, vomiting, fatigue.
- 2–6 Gy: severe symptoms, recovery possible with treatment.
- >6 Gy: potentially fatal without immediate medical intervention.
The illness progresses through prodromal, latent, and manifest stages, affecting bone
marrow, gastrointestinal system, and nervous system based on dose.
# Radiation Units and Operational Limits
![[Pasted image 20250505234444.png]]
Radiation measurement units include:
- **Becquerel (Bq):** Activity of a radioactive source (1 decay/sec).
- **Gray (Gy):** Absorbed dose (1 joule/kg).
- **Sievert (Sv):** Equivalent dose considering biological damage.
Operational exposure limits:
- **Occupational workers:** ≤ 20 mSv/year (averaged over 5 years).
- **General public:** ≤ 1 mSv/year.
Monitoring and compliance are regulated by bodies like ICRP, NCRP, and AERB in India.


## Radiation Survey Meters
Survey meters measure radiation dose rates or contamination levels. Common types:
- **Geiger-Müller counter:** Detects α, β, and γ rays; provides count rate.
- **Ionization chamber:** Accurate dose rate measurement; used for high-intensity fields.
- **Scintillation detector:** Detects low-energy radiation; high sensitivity. These
instruments are used in labs, hospitals, and nuclear facilities for safety monitoring.
- **Pocket Dosimeter** A personal monitoring device for individuals exposed to radiation at work. eg : **Pen dosimeter:** Electromechanical **TLD badge (Thermoluminescent Dosimeter releases it as light when heated, giving cumulative dose.
- **Digital dosimeter:** Electronic device with real-time readout and alarms for dose
thresholds. These devices ensure that workers remain within legal exposure limits.
# Control of Radiation Hazards
Radiation protection follows the ALARA principle (As Low As Reasonably Achievable),
applying:
- **Time:** Minimize duration of exposure.
- **Distance:** Maximize distance from source.
- **Shielding:** Use appropriate barriers (lead for γ, plastic for β, paper for α).
Engineering controls (e.g., containment), administrative controls (e.g., zoning), and personal
protective equipment (PPE) are also used.

# Radiation Therapy
Radiation therapy treats cancer by damaging the DNA of cancerous cells, preventing their
division. Modalities include:
- **External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT):** High-energy X-rays or electrons targeted at
tumors.
- **Brachytherapy:** Radioactive sources placed inside or near the tumor.
- **Systemic radioisotope therapy:** Involves ingesting or injecting radioactive substances
(e.g., I-131 for thyroid). Treatment planning ensures maximum tumor destruction with
minimal damage to healthy tissue.
## Radioisotopes Used for Therapy
Radioisotopes used in medicine emit beta or gamma radiation. Examples:
- **Iodine-131:** Treats hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer.
- **Cobalt-60:** External radiotherapy source.
- **Iridium-192:** Used in high dose-rate brachytherapy.
- **Strontium-89 and Samarium-153:** Palliative care for bone cancer pain. Proper
handling and disposal of these isotopes are vital for radiation safety.
## Nuclear Medicine
Nuclear medicine uses radiopharmaceuticals for diagnosis and therapy. Diagnostic imaging
techniques include:
- **SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography)** and **PET (Positron
Emission Tomography)**.
Common diagnostic isotopes:
- **Technetium-99m:** Used in bone scans, cardiac imaging.
- **Fluorine-18:** Used in PET scans for oncology.
These procedures are minimally invasive and highly sensitive.

# Industrial Applications
Radiation is used in multiple industrial domains:
- **Non-destructive testing (NDT):** Inspecting metal structures via radiography.
- **Sterilization:** Gamma rays sterilize medical products and food packaging.
- **Thickness/Level Gauging:** Monitors in paper, plastic, or steel industries.
- **Well logging:** In petroleum exploration, radiation helps evaluate subsurface structures.

**Employee is exposed to a gamma source with a dose rate of 0.5 MSv per hour at a distance of 2m from source. Calculate the total dose recieved if the labourer spends 15mins at 2m from the source and 45min at 5m from the source. Assume the dose rate follows inverse square law.** 

**Dose rate of 2MSv/hour if he spends 30min at 4m and 1hr at 8m calculate total dose recieved. **
