There is a strange order to the way topics are presented here.. I shall combine the two in some Frankenstein's monster-ish way that works in my imagination. 

We zoot down to the level of the atom and observe the [[Nuclear Structure]] , see some proposed [[Nuclear Models]] and understand their behaviour by studing [[Nuclear reactions]] and [[Nuclear Decay]] which are studied with [[Radiation detectors]]. We discuss the hazards of radiation by looking into [[Radiation physics]].  Aren't [[Particle accelerator]]s cool ? they can be used to study [[Particle Physics]]
