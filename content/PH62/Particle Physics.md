# Classification of elementary particles

Is a massive task. Some propose the Standard model as a solution..

Bosons are force carriers, fermions are charge carriers ? 
Higgs are part of the Boson cahrt too

**Compare the gravitational force strength and electromanetic strength of two protons **

$\frac{F_{E}}{F_{grav}}=1.2e{3}6$

# Conservation laws
We assume that elementay particles do follow the conservation laws. 
1. Charge 
2. Baryon number
3. Lepton number
4. Strangeness 
5. Isospin


Consider the following reaction 
$$
n\to p+e^-+\nu^-_{e}
$$
charge is conserved here $(0)\to(1)+(-1)+(0)$
Baryon number is conserved $(1)\to(1)+(0)+(0)$
Lepton number $(0)\to(0)+(1)+(-1)$
Strangeness

**Verify if the following are possible**
**Baryonic**
1. $p+p\to p+\bar{p}$
Baryon number isnt conserved. $\bar{p}$ has -1
2. $p+p+\bar{n}\to \bar{n}+\bar{p}+p$
Baryon number not conserved (1,-1)
3. $\bar{p}+p\to e^++p+\bar{n}+e^-$ 
Baryon number conservved (0,0)
4. $p+p\to e^++e^-+p+\bar{p}$
Baryon number is not conserved (2,0) 
5. $p+p\to p+\bar{p}+\bar{n}+p$
Baryon number is not conserved (2,0)
6. $p+p\to p+p+p+\bar{p}$
Baryon number conserved $(2,2)$

**Leptonic**
1. $\mu^-\to e^-+\bar{\nu}_{e}$
Leptonic number not conserved (1,0)
2. $\mu^+\to e^++\nu_{e}+\bar{\nu_{\mu}}$
Lepton number conserved (1,)


# Feynman Diagrams

A better way of understanding reactions is to, like in all other fields of physics is to draw it out ! 
You have time along one axis, space in the other and you describe the interaction as thus

# Strange particles and strangeness
This has nice history ! it was the result of a feud that took place across decades regarding the '*Tau Theta*' puzzle regarding two identical but different rays observed on photographic plates back then![[Pasted image 20250506131314.png|500]]

That eventually led to the [Lee and Yang paper of 1956](https://drive.proton.me/urls/84CJMDX8XC#aOTPX2C0bp8I) and of course the famous [Wu experiment ](https://drive.proton.me/urls/X76PRS7J30#jJXB8ay4iJ9f) executed a few months later. You can find more about the tau theta puzzle in this [little repository I have made for you here](https://drive.proton.me/urls/0T0T1WK1G8#NwgYnL5bRaz0)


Consider $p^++\pi^-\to\lambda^0+K^0$ and $p^++\pi^-\to n+K^0$ 
both of them conserve charge, lepton and baryon number but reaction 1 happened more often than reaction 2, There were certain group of particles found to be produced via strong interactions / strong force interactions mediated by gluons. But these particles decayed via *weak interactions* this group of particles came to be known as strange particles and thus the concept of strangeness was introduced to answer this puzzle. A new 'strangeness' quantum  number was introduced to explain this. 
These particles would have atleast 1 *strange quark* in them. 

This idea of using probability to judge likeliness of a reaction is one way stat mech has influenced the flow of logic in this field. 

Because particles show concept of strangeness are produced by strong interaction, they must **conserve** strangeness (WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ??). But if they are decaying via weak interaction, the products need not conserve strangeness hence this is called as a partial conservation law (I just woke up.. whaaaat ?). 
Strangeness is a property of weak (THAT'S JUDGEMENTAL !) interaction. Using the conservation laws of charge, Lepton number, Baryon number and strangeness determine the unknown particle in the following interaction. 


|             | Baryon | Lepton e | Lepton $\mu$ | Lepton $\tau$ | S   |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | ------------ | ------------- | --- |
| $K^+$       | 0      | 0        | 0            | 0             | 1   |
| $\Lambda^0$ | 1      |          |              |               | -1  |
| $\Sigma^+$  | 1      |          |              |               | -1  |
| $\Sigma^-$  | 1      |          |              |               | -1  |
| $\Sigma^0$  | 1      |          |              |               | -1  |
| $\Omega^-$  | 1      |          |              |               | -3  |
| $K^0$       | 0      |          |              |               | 1   |

# Color charge 
![[Pasted image 20250506002604.png | 200]] 
- A cringy old Kannada song *Colour Color cOloRR*

**Color charge** is *yet* another fundamental property of quarks,

- Quarks are [[Fermions]] and all fermions must obey Pauli's Exclusion principle. Consider  a Baryon having 3 up quarks -> $\Delta^{++}:(up,up,up)$
- all up quarks in this Baryon have the same quantum numbers Which is a contradiction to Pauli's exclusion principle. 
- To resolve this issue, physicists invented another quantum property of quarks, which we now call color. (Anti quarks are given anti color )
Physicists thought they could explain this by introducing the concept of **color charge**, which can be <span style="color: olive;">Red</span>,<span style="color: maroon;">Blue</span> or <span style="color: teal;">Green</span> If it's a meson, a two quark bound system, then we have color and anti color assigned to it. This results in a colorless Baryon or meson. 

Analogous to an electron carrying electric charge, quarks carry color charge.  And the strong nuclear force that the quarks feel due to other quarks are known as the color forces. 


![[particlephys.png|500]]
The strong force between quarks is called the **color force**, and it’s much stronger than electromagnetism. This interaction is described by **quantum chromodynamics (QCD)**, which explains how quarks exchange particles called **gluons** that carry color charge themselves. Importantly, all observable particles are **colorless** overall — meaning the combination of colors always results in a neutral, confined state.

## Charge conjugation 
Mathematical operation : turns a particle anti by switching the charge on the quarks example: 
$$
Proton^+(uud)\to Proton^-(\bar{u}\bar{u}\bar{d})
$$
## Parity

It's a mathematical operation form of the word 'Ulta' .. ಉಲ್ಟಾ
$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{P}\Psi(x)=\Psi(-x)\\\hat{P}\Psi(x,y,t)=\Psi(-x,-y,-t)
\end{aligned}
$$
it's very much like staring into a mirror - everything is reversed
