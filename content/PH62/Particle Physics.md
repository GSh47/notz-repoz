# Standard model 

![[Pasted image 20250228111410.png]]

- [ ] Solar Neutrino problem 
- [ ] Color charge 

Bosons are force carriers, fermions are charge carriers ? 
Higgs are part of the Boson cahrt too

**Compare the gravitational force strength and electromanetic strength of two protons **

$\frac{F_{E}}{F_{grav}}=1.2e{3}6$

# Conservation laws
We assume that elementay particles do follow the conservation laws. 
1. Charge 
2. Baryon number
3. Lepton number
4. Strangeness 
5. Isospin


Consider the following reaction 
$$
n\to p+e^-+\nu^-_{e}
$$
charge is conserved here $(0)\to(1)+(-1)+(0)$
Baryon number is conserved $(1)\to(1)+(0)+(0)$
Lepton number $(0)\to(0)+(1)+(-1)$
Strangeness

**Verify if the following are possible**
**Baryonic**
1. $p+p\to p+\bar{p}$
Baryon number isnt conserved. $\bar{p}$ has -1
2. $p+p+\bar{n}\to \bar{n}+\bar{p}+p$
Baryon number not conserved (1,-1)
3. $\bar{p}+p\to e^++p+\bar{n}+e^-$ 
Baryon number conservved (0,0)
4. $p+p\to e^++e^-+p+\bar{p}$
Baryon number is not conserved (2,0) 
5. $p+p\to p+\bar{p}+\bar{n}+p$
Baryon number is not conserved (2,0)
6. $p+p\to p+p+p+\bar{p}$
Baryon number conserved $(2,2)$

**Leptonic**
1. $\mu^-\to e^-+\bar{\nu}_{e}$
Leptonic number not conserved (1,0)
2. $\mu^+\to e^++\nu_{e}+\bar{\nu_{\mu}}$
Lepton number conserved (1,)

# Strange particles and strangeness

Consider $p^++\pi^-\to\lambda^0+K^0$ and $p^++\pi^-\to n+K^0$ 
both of them conserve charge, lepton and baryon number but reaction 1 happened more often than reaction 2, There were certain group of particles found to be produced via strong interactions / strong force interactions mediated by gluons. But these particles decayed via weak interactions this group of particles came to be known as strange particles and thus the concept of strangeness was introduced to answer this puzzle. A new 'strangeness' quantum  number was introduced to explain this. 
These particles would have atleast 1 strange quark in them. 
In the above example, 
Because particles show concept of strangeness are produced by strong interaction, they must conserve strangeness. but if they are decaying via weak interaction, the products need not conserve strangeness hence this is called as a partial conservation law. 
Strangeness is a property of weak. Using the conservation laws of charge, Lepton number, Baryon number and strangeness determine the unknown particle in the following interaction. 


|             | Baryon | Lepton e | Lepton $\mu$ | Lepton $\tau$ | S   |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | ------------ | ------------- | --- |
| $K^+$       | 0      | 0        | 0            | 0             | 1   |
| $\Lambda^0$ | 1      |          |              |               | -1  |
| $\Sigma^+$  | 1      |          |              |               | -1  |
| $\Sigma^-$  | 1      |          |              |               | -1  |
| $\Sigma^0$  | 1      |          |              |               | -1  |
| $\Omega^-$  | 1      |          |              |               | -3  |
| $K^0$       | 0      |          |              |               | 1   |

# Color charge 

A property of quarks - 
Green - down
red - up
blue - up

Quarks are [[Fermions]] and all fermions must obey Pauli's Exclusion principle. Consider  a Baryon having 3 up quarks,
all up quarks in this Baryon have the same quantum numbers Which is a contradiction to Pauli's exclusion principle. 
To resolve this issue, physicists invented another quantum property of quarks, which we now call color. 
Anti quarks are given anti color. If it's a BAryon, a 3 quark bound system. The color quantum proprty assigned is RGB, 
If it's a meson, a two quark bound system, then we have color and color assigned to it. This results in a colorless Baryon or meson. 
Analogous to an electron carrying electric charge, quarks carry color charge.  And the strong nuclear force that the quarks feel due to other quarks are known as the color forces.

# Charge conjugation 
mathmatical operation : turns a particle anti by switching the charge on the quarks example: 
$$
Proton^+(uud)\to Proton^-(\bar{u}\bar{u}\bar{d})
$$
# Parity

It's a mathematical operation 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{P}\Psi(x)=\Psi(-x)\\\hat{P}\Psi(x,y,t)=\Psi(-x,-y,-t)
\end{aligned}
$$
# Time reversal

**Use supernova of 1968 to estimate the mass of the neutrino assume that two neutrinos leave the supernova at hte same time and arrive on earth 10 seconds apart given KE of neutrino is $20MeV$ and $10MeV$ given the superova is at a distance of 0.17 Million Light years from earth. **
