   Magic numbers of protons and neutrons have been interpreted as forming closed shells of protons or neutrons, analogous to the filling of electronic shells in atoms. 
   
   Each shell is limited to a certain number of protons and neutrons. When a shell is filled, the resulting configuration is very stable and has unusually low energy.

 1. Magic numbers of protons and neutrons are interpreted as forming closed shells of neutrons or protons, analogous to the filling of electronic shells in atoms.
 2. Neutron and proton shells appear to be independent of each other.
 3. **Stability** of a nucleus is related not only to high binding energy but also to high natural abundance.
4. **Relative stability** for different elements is often indicated by the number of stable isotopes per element.
5. Atoms with magic numbers of neutrons tend to have more stable isotopes.
6. Example: If neutron number $N = 50$, the number of stable isotopes associated with it is 6.
7. **Energy emitted** with $\alpha$ or $\beta$ decay for elements that decay into a magic number of nuclei is very high.

8. **Absorption cross-section** for neutrons is very low for nuclei having magic numbers $50, 82, 126$, i.e., they do not absorb neutrons readily.
9. When a shell is filled, the resulting configuration is very stable and has an unusually low energy.
