- A typical photomultiplier has multiplication factor of $10^6$ electrons, i.e each electron creates million electrons 
- There are $n$ stages in a dynode, of multiplication factor of $m$. Giving us total multiplication factor of $m^n$ 
- Not ll photoelectrons create electrons
- Energy of incident ionising particle ($E_{i}$) and the average energy of emmitted electrons is $E_{\nu}$. The conversion efficeincy is given as $\eta$. the number of emitted electrons $N_{1}$ is given by : 
$$
N_{1}=\eta\frac{E_{i}}{E_{\nu}}
$$
- If $N_{2}$ is the number of incident photons, then $\alpha$ is called the fraction of fraction of total number of photons falling on the photocathode and $T$ is photocathode transparency, we have.
$$
N_{2}=\alpha TN_{1}
$$

- These photons are then converted into photoelectrons with efficiency of $\eta_{e}$ The number of photoelectrons produced by photocathode is 
$$ 
N=\eta_{e}N_{2}
$$
- If $D$ is the fraction of photoelectrons reaching the first dynode, and $m$ is the multiplication factor of each dynode, then the number of eletrons collected at anode is 
$$
N_{e}=DNm^n
$$
- The total charge is 
$$
Q=\left( \eta   \frac{E_{i}}{E_{\nu}} \right)(\alpha TN_{1})(DNm^n)e
$$
and the pulse height is 
$$
\begin{aligned}
V&=\frac{Q}{C}\\&= \left( \eta   \frac{E_{i}}{E_{\nu}} \right)(\alpha TN_{1})(DNm^n)e
\end{aligned}
$$
