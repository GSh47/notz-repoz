The need for a model arose from observations of several experiments like $\alpha$ scattering

# Nuclear models

In the absence of a detailed theory of nuclear structure, attempts have been made to correlate experimental data with theoretical models. Each model serves to correlate a portion of our experimental knowledge about nuclei but fails when applied to data outside this range.
# Shell Model

### Basis
1. Many nuclear properties vary periodically in a similar manner to the periodic nature of elements in the periodic table. 
2. Most of these properties show discontinuities in certain even values of proton or neutron numbers.
   Example:  
   If the number of protons is $Z$, then the number of neutrons is $N = (A - Z)$.
   At $N = 2, 8, 20, 50, 82, 126$, the nuclei become very stable. These numbers are called [[Magic numbers]]
   
The above results associated with magic nuclei have been interpreted as neutrons or protons within the nucleus arranged into their shells without violating the shell-like idea of an atom.

## Assumptions

- Each nucleon moves in its orbit within the nucleus, independent of all other nucleons.
- The orbit is determined by a potential energy function $V(r)$.
- $V(r)$ represents the average effect of all interactions with other nucleons.
- $V(r)$ is the same for all nucleons.
- Interaction between nucleons is a small perturbation on the interaction between the nucleon and the potential field.
- The potential describes the nuclear attraction as a form between square well potential $V(r) = -V_0$ and an oscillator potential $V(r) = -V_0 + a r^2$, where $r$ is the distance between the nucleon and the center of force, and $a$ is a constant.

## Theory
This model assumes that the nucleus is made of two different kinds of particles protons and neutrons have been considered. The Pauli's exclusion principle must be applied to both protons and neutrons, implying that no two protons or neutrons can have same two quantum numbers. 

If we look at the harmonic oscillator function, there will be closed cells at $2, 8, 20, 40,70$ but  $50, 82, 126$ are missing, those shell numbers appear to have no connection with experimental observations. 

- Infinite well potential predict closed shells at $2,8,20$ and many other non-magic numbers. $50,82,126$ are again missing. 

THis implies, to get the correct shell numbers we must make another assumption, nucleons energy depends on whether it's spin angular momentum is paralell or anti paralell with its orbital angular momentum (spin-orbit) coupling. 

**When this assumption is made, we get closed nucleon shells at $2,8,20,50,82,126$  in agreement with the experimental data.**

## Advantages of shell model, 
1. It predicts the totaal angular momenta of nuclei in good agreement with the experiment. Very useful in studying beta decay. 
2. Using shell model, a correlation has been found between nucleon isomerism (existence of longlived excited states) and magic numbers. 
3. Shell model can be used to predict total angular moment, low lying excited states
4. Experimental data for magic moments/numbers and electric quadrupole moments are also been integrated in terms of shell models.
   
   Eg: if proton numbers are magic, then quadrupole moment is eithe zero or very small number. When a new shell begins to form. Quadrupole number is negative as the number of protons in the unfilled shell is increased, Quadrupole numer becomes positive, and is maximum when it's 2/3 filled. 

Drawbacks 
1. The shell model assumes a sphereical shape for the nucleus could not explain 
	1. excited states of even-even nuclei
	2. Magnitude of nuclear quadrupole moments, 
	3. magnetic moments of some nuclei. 
2. Probability of radioactive transitions. 

Neutron and proton shells appear to be independent of each other. Stability of a nucleus is related not only to high binding energy but also to high natural abundance. Relative stability of different elements is also indicated by the number of stable isotopes per element. Atoms having magic numbers of neutrons generally tend to have more stable isotopes, i.e., if you have neutron number $= 50$, then the number of stable isotopes associated with it is $\approx 6$.

Energies emitted in $\alpha$ and $\beta$ decay for elements that decay into a magic number of nuclei are very high. Absorption cross-section for neutrons is very low for nuclei having magic numbers $50, 82$ and $126$, i.e., they do not absorb neutrons readily.

The above results associated with magic nuclei have been interpreted as an indication that protons and neutrons within the nucleus are arranged into shells within the nucleus, like electrons in an atom.
