You might remember the 'Shaking method' to figure out whats in a box .. And this is how you shake a box - or a particle in this case .. 

By smashing them in the face with another particle. 

here's schematics and discussions on 2 types taught in class
# Cyclotron
![[Cyc.png|400]]

A **cyclotron** is a type of particle accelerator that uses a **constant magnetic field** and a **constant-frequency alternating electric field** to accelerate charged particles in a **spiral trajectory**. 

One can derive the frequency of oscillations as seen
$$
\begin{aligned}
F=&qvB\\ \frac{mv^{2}}{R}=& qvB\\ t=\frac{2\pi R}{v} \implies &f= \frac{v}{2\pi R} \\ \\f=& \frac{\left( \frac{qBR}{m} \right)}{2\pi R}\\ \\ \fbox{$f=\frac{qB}{2\pi m}$}\\ 
\end{aligned}
$$

To account for relativistic changes, divide by gamma : $$f=\frac{qB}{2\pi m} \sqrt{ 1- \frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}} }$$



# Betatrons

The emf from varying mag field exerted by electromagnet is $\mathcal{E}=-\frac{d\phi}{dt}$ and thus

the work done is $qV=\mathcal{E}e$ also $W=Fdv=F_{1}\cdot{2}\pi R$

$$

\begin{aligned}

2\pi RF_{1}=e\mathcal{E}\\

F_{1}=\frac{\mathcal{E}e}{2\pi R}\\=\frac{e}{2\pi R} \frac{d\phi}{dt}

\end{aligned}

$$

and by Lorentz law, $F=qVB=eVB$ and centrifugal is $\frac{mv^{2}}{R}$

giving us $mv={eRB}$, we can calculate the force if the mag field varies by :

$$

\begin{aligned}

mv=p=&eRB\\

\frac{dp}{dt}= F=&\frac{d}{dt}(eRB)\\=&eR \frac{dB}{dt}

\end{aligned}

$$

Now,

$$

\begin{aligned}

F_{1}=&F_{2}\\

\frac{e}{2\pi R} \frac{d\phi}{dt} =&eR \frac{dB}{dt}\\

\mathcal{E}=\frac{d\phi}{dt}=&2\pi R^{2} \frac{dB}{dt}

\end{aligned}

$$
