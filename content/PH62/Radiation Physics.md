**Employee is exposed to a gamma source with a dose rate of 0.5 MSv per hour at a distance of 2m from source. Calculate the total dose recieved if the labourer spends 15mins at 2m from the source and 45min at 5m from the source. Assume the dose rate follows inverse square law.** 

**Dose rate of 2MSv/hour if he spends 30min at 4m and 1hr at 8m calculate total dose recieved. **
