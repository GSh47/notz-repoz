This suggests there might be a typo in the problem statement. Instead, let’s assume the correct definition is:\nP_k(x) = x^k + x^{k+1} + \\dots + x^n,\nwhich is a polynomial of degree n for each k. This interpretation makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\nStep 2: Write the linear combination\nConsider the linear combination:\nc_0 P_0(x) + c_1 P_1(x) + \\dots + c_n P_n(x) = 0.\nSubstitute the definition of P_k(x):\nc_0 (x^0 + x^1 + \\dots + x^n) + c_1 (x^1 + x^2 + \\dots + x^n) + \\dots + c_n (x^n) = 0.\n\nStep 3: Collect like terms\nRewrite the equation by collecting terms with the same power of x:\nc_0 x^0 + (c_0 + c_1) x^1 + (c_0 + c_1 + c_2) x^2 + \\dots + (c_0 + c_1 + \\dots + c_n) x^n = 0.\nFor this equation to hold for all x, the coefficient of each power of x must be zero. This gives us the system of equations:\n\\begin{cases}\nc_0 = 0, \\\\\nc_0 + c_1 = 0, \\\\\nc_0 + c_1 + c_2 = 0, \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nc_0 + c_1 + \\dots + c_n = 0.\n\\end{cases}\n\nStep 4: Solve the system of equations\nFrom the first equation, c_0 = 0. Substituting c_0 = 0 into the second equation gives c_1 = 0. Substituting c_0 = c_1 = 0 into the third equation gives c_2 = 0. Continuing this process, we find:\nc_0 = c_1 = c_2 = \\dots = c_n = 0.\n\nStep 5: Conclude linear independence\nSince the only solution to the equation c_0 P_0(x) + c_1 P_1(x) + \\dots + c_n P_n(x) = 0 is c_0 = c_1 = \\dots = c_n = 0, the set \\{ P_0(x), P_1(x), \\dots, P_n(x) \\} is linearly independent in P_n(F).\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe set \\{ P_0(x), P_1(x), \\dots, P_n(x) \\} is linearly independent in P_n(F).\ntheorem let V be a vectorspace and let S_{1}\\subset S_{2}\\subset V.

By Theorem 1.9 some subset H of G is a basis for V. Corollary 1 implies that H contains exactly n vectors. Since a subset of G contains n vectors, G must contain at least n vectors. Moreover, if G contains exactly n vectors, then we must have H = G, so that G is a basis for V.\n(b) Let L be a linearly independent subset of V containing exactly n vectors. It follows from the replacement theorem that there is a subset H of\nft containing n — n = 0 vectors such that L U H generates V. Thus H = 0, and L generates V.
